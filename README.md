Data Modeling with Postgres & Python for RDBMS

Let's say we want 20 random employee details, the company they are working and what the company does. Here, I have created my own 3 csv files, model them and import that to Postgres

In order to build a good data model, we need to understand our data!

Step 1: Importing libraries and reading those 3 dataframes
Step 2: Creating connection to the Postgres localhost so that we can communicate with the DB using Python
Step 3: Create tables and create an Entity Relationship between them!
Step 4: We gotta import our data to our Postgres DB. We will iterate through each row in our DataFrame and executing them.
Step 5: Commiting our transactions.
