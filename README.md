Data Modeling with Postgres & Python for RDBMS

Let's say we want 20 random employee details, the company they are working and what the company does. Here, I have created my own 3 CSV files, model them and import that to Postgres

To build a good data model, we need to understand our data!

Step 1: Importing libraries and reading those 3 data frames

Step 2: Create connection to the Postgres localhost so that we can communicate with the DB using Python

Step 3: Create tables and create an Entity Relationship between them!

Step 4: We gotta import our data to our Postgres DB. We will iterate through each row in our DataFrame and execute them.

Step 5: Committing our transactions.


The data files used in this project are small but the techniques used here can be used to model big data.
